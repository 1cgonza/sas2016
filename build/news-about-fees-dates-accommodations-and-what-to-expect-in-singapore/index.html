Average temperatures between 23 and 34 degree Celsius all year round. But nothing too fear-the next air-con shelter is always close, water is available everywhere, buildings are all equipped with well working air con. NTU has covered walkways to protect from the sun as well, a concept you can find throughout the city.</p><p>Food is available in a wide variety of pricing starting from an affordable S$5-10 hawker meal to high-end restaurants. Street food is generally safe and often delicious. All types of cuisine are catering to Singapore’s large cosmopolitan population.</p><h2 id=transportation>Transportation</h2><h3 id=arriving-in-singapore>Arriving in Singapore</h3><p>All major international flights arrive in <a href="http://www.changiairport.com/" target=_blank>Changi Airport</a>, certainly one of the best airports in the world with a welcoming and friendly atmosphere.</p><p>Very clean and efficient, free trolleys and clear signage.</p><p>Immigration is perfectly organized and works very fast, no long lines to fear.</p><ul><li>Flights from the <strong>US</strong>: S$ 2000 - 2500</li><li>Flights from <strong>Europe</strong>: S$ 1200 - 1500</li><li>Flights from <strong>Asia</strong> <em>(close destinations like Indonesia, Malaysia)</em>: S$ 300 -1000</li><li>Flights from <strong>Australia and New Zealand</strong>: S$ 700 - 1000</li></ul><p>All prices are rough estimates based on 1 person round trip from a major city. Prices vary great due to availability. The earlier you book-the cheaper it will be.</p><h3 id=getting-around-in-singapore>Getting around in Singapore</h3><p><span class=highlight>Easy:</span> A well organized MRT system (public trains), busses and the comparatively cheap and 100% trustworthy taxis are available.</p><p>A taxi ride from Changi Airport to the conference venue (Nanyang Technological University) will set you back between S$45 - 60 depending on the time of day. But this will already cover the widest distance you will be able to travel on our island because you are going all the way from the East to the West coast. The ride will take you roundabout 45 minutes and be about 40 km.</p><p>A ride from NTU (conference venue) to the city center will be 25 km and cost you roughly S$25 - 30, cheaper outside of peak hours.</p><p>Alternatively busses are available to the next MRT station (Boon Lay) or you can take a taxi to go there. That brings down the price of transportation drastically, if you are travelling on a budget.</p><h2 id=accommodation>Accommodation</h2><h3 id=nanyang-executive-centre>Nanyang Executive Centre</h3><p>We have pre-reserved rooms at a special rate at the hotel closest to the conference venue: NTU’s own <a href=http://www.ntu.edu.sg/nec/Pages/default.aspx>Nanyang Executive Centre</a>.</p><p>It is in easy walking distance (5 minutes) from our School of Art, Design and Media. Those who are looking for a convenient and solid accommodation option at a reasonable price (for Singapore), you are in the right place here. The booking link will go up together with actual registration in early February. You will have to book on your own, referencing:</p><p><span class="zoom-font highlight-box-soft-w"><strong>“SAS Conference 2016 NTU”</strong></span></p><p>Rates are as follows (prevailing taxes will apply)</p><ul><li>Standard room with daily breakfast: <strong>S$144</strong></li><li>Twin room with daily breakfast: <strong>S$162</strong></li><li>Deluxe room with daily breakfast: <strong>S$189</strong></li></ul><p>We are in further negotiations with downtown hotels for those who want to stay in the City center (roughly abut 30 - 40 minutes way from NTU = conference venue).</p><p>Details will follow.</p><h3 id=student-halls>Student Halls</h3><p>We are also looking into securing accommodation on the budget side.</p><p>We are optimistic to be able to offer additional accommodation at low rates as detailed below. We are in the process of finalizing the sign-up process for this, which will be different from the hotel-bookings.</p><p>However, we thought, it will help your consideration of making the trip to Singapore that there will also be cheaper option available.</p><p>Be aware though that this will be <span class=highlight>budget (!) accommodation in student halls</span> and rather basic.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Daily rental charges on a per person basis</th><th>Twin/sharing</th><th>Single</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Students</td><td><strong>AC:</strong> S$30<br><strong>Non AC:</strong> S$20</td><td><strong>AC:</strong> S$38<br><strong>Non AC:</strong> S$28</td></tr><tr><td>Non-student</td><td><strong>AC:</strong> S$45<br><strong>Non AC:</strong> S$30</td><td><strong>AC:</strong> S$59<br><strong>Non AC:</strong> S$44</td></tr></tbody></table></main><footer id=site-footer><p>&copy; School of Art, Design &amp; Media - Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</p><img src=http://sas2016.adm.ntu.edu.sg/img/bg-footer.svg alt=""></footer></body></html>
