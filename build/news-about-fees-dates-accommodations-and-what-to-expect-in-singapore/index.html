This is <span class=highlight>not (!) a pre-requisite</span> for submitting a proposal or being accepted though.</p><p><span class=highlight>You can become a member after paper-acceptance!</span> It does not cost much (US$35 - pros / US$20 students) and offers great value: For more information on the membership, go to its <a href=http://ww2.animationstudies.org/index.php/membership/member-join target=_blank>webpage</a> or contact the SAS treasurer, Robert Musburger, at <a href=mailto:rmusburger@comcast.net>rmusburger@comcast.net</a></p><h2 id=coming-to-singapore>Coming to Singapore</h2><p>Singapore offers an extremely clean, safe and efficient environment, which makes visiting entirely easy and stress-free.</p><p>The climate is tropical and highly humid, we are close to the equator. Average temperatures between 23 and 34 degree Celsius all year round. But nothing too fear-the next air-con shelter is always close, water is available everywhere, buildings are all equipped with well working air con. NTU has covered walkways to protect from the sun as well, a concept you can find throughout the city.</p><p>Food is available in a wide variety of pricing starting from an affordable S$5-10 hawker meal to high-end restaurants. Street food is generally safe and often delicious. All types of cuisine are catering to Singaporeâ€™s large cosmopolitan population.</p><h2 id=transportation>Transportation</h2><h3 id=arriving-in-singapore>Arriving in Singapore</h3><p>All major international flights arrive in <a href=http://www.changiairport.com/ target=_blank>Changi Airport</a>, certainly one of the best airports in the world with a welcoming and friendly atmosphere.</p><p>Very clean and efficient, free trolleys and clear signage.</p><p>Immigration is perfectly organized and works very fast, no long lines to fear.</p><ul><li>Flights from the <strong>US</strong>: S$2000 - 2500</li><li>Flights from <strong>Europe</strong>: S$1200 - 1500</li><li>Flights from <strong>Asia</strong> <em>(close destinations like Indonesia, Malaysia)</em>: S$300 -1000</li><li>Flights from <strong>Australia and New Zealand</strong>: S$700 - 1000</li></ul><p>All prices are rough estimates based on 1 person round trip from a major city. Prices vary greatly due to availability. The earlier you book-the cheaper it will be.</p><h3 id=getting-around-in-singapore>Getting around in Singapore</h3><p><span class=highlight>Easy:</span> A well organized MRT system (public trains), buses and, the comparatively cheap and 100% trustworthy, taxis are available.</p><p>A taxi ride from Changi Airport to the conference venue (Nanyang Technological University) will set you back between S$45 - 60 depending on the time of day. But this will already cover the widest distance you will be able to travel on our island because you are going all the way from the East to the West coast. The ride will take you roundabout 45 minutes and be about 40 km.</p><p>A ride from NTU (conference venue) to the city center will be 25 km and cost you roughly S$25 - 30, cheaper outside of peak hours.</p><p>Alternatively buses are available to the next MRT station (Boon Lay) or you can take a taxi to go there. That brings down the price of transportation drastically, if you are travelling on a budget.</p><h2 id=accommodation>Accommodation</h2><p>Please refer to the <a class=highlight href=/accommodation>Accommodation</a> page for the most up to date information.</p></section></article></main><footer id=site-footer role=contentinfo><p>&copy; School of Art, Design &amp; Media - Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</p></footer><script src=http://sas2016.adm.ntu.edu.sg/js/scripts.js type=text/javascript></script></body></html>
