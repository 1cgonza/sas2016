    <p>The Society for Animation Studies has always excelled in bringing together theorists and practitioners from different fields and cultures in an international framework. <strong>“The Cosmos of Animation”</strong> reflects and continues this proud tradition in the multi-cultural and cosmopolitan city of Singapore- a wonderful place to establish transcultural dialogue through scholarly debate. As the universe itself, animation is constantly evolving and often rapidly changing. We look forward to papers and presentations that embrace the conceptual and cultural diversity of animation in all of its many incarnations.</p>
    <p>The 2016 conference will include presentations, roundtable discussion, discussions, exclusive exhibitions and special events. We are proud to announce two confirmed keynote-speakers: Professor Thomas Haegele (former Director of the Animation Institute at Filmakademie Baden-Wuerttemberg, TBD) and Teresa Cheng (General Manager, Lucasfilm Singapore TBD)</p>
