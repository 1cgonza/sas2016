# Accommodation information
We are offering a variety of options for your stay during the conference:
- Budget accommodation in [student hostels](#nanyang-technological-university-hostel) on campus. Available to students and non-students at different rates.
- Two hotels in medium-price-range [on campus](#nanyang-executive-centre) and [close to campus](#genting-hotel).
- 1 [upscale hotel](#mandarin-orchard-singapore) downtown with complimentary daily transportation to the conference included (with the exception of the opening Sunday).

All have given special rates for the conference. You can find the details and booking forms/links below.

Please be aware that all of the rooms and rates are subject to availability -so <span class="highlight">booking early</span> is <span class="highlight">highly recommended.</span>

You might also consider combining two of these options for your stay -
as some conference participants already have. That makes sense in the case that you are arriving before the conference starts or leave later.
The hotels have agreed to extend the conference rates 1-2 days before and
after the conference ends (see individual forms for details).

For all clarifications and questions on accommodation options, please e-mail to <a href="mailto:sec_sas2016@ntu.edu.sg?subject=Accommodations Inquiry">sec_sas2016@ntu.edu.sg</a>

## Nanyang Technological University Hostel
The accommodation is within the campus of the Nanyang Technological University. Only <span class="highlight">single rooms</span> are available. You can reserve individually with us through the reservation form below - but we have to confirm a group after we have consolidated all requests.

To abide to the requirement from the facilities provider, we regret to inform you that we have only a <strong>single period</strong> of the accommodation - this is mandatory.

Booking is only available for the full conference period as indicated blow:

All booking of the hostel has to be paid full upon confirmation and no refund or other change in the duration of the stays.

<h4>Check-in: 25 June 2016, 2pm and 6pm</h4>
<h4>Check-out: 1 Jul 2016, 11am</h4>

Singapore is in the tropics and the climate is very humid and can be very hot.
Consider well, if you really feel fit to consider a room without aircon.

### Rates
***All prices are per person and for the full duration. All rates already inclusive of 10% service charge and 7% GST = final prizes. All rooms subject to availability.***
