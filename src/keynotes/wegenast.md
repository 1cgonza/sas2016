<h4>Abstract</h4>

Starting with the concepts and cultural practices of the Expanded Cinema of the 1960s and their protagonists like Stan VanDerBeek and Jordan Belson the lectures explores the relation between animation and other artististic disciplines like architecture and performance. More and more animators become producers of virtual spaces. Through this concept of animated spatial communication the role and meaning of architecture and scenography is changing and becomes more dynamic and fluid. The borderline between digital and real spaces is vanishing. Artists like Max Hattler and Robert Seidel or studios like Universal Everything expand the space by combining materiality and projection. But also within animated films the importance of space concepts shouldn’t be undervalued. More than in other filmic formats the creation of space itself is a constitutional element and part of the artistic process of animation production. By discussing five approaches how to create different forms of spaces (fantastic, conceptual, bricolage...) the lectures tries to illustrate the potential of the animation medium if it comes the establishment of space in narrative and traditional animation, in experimental film, and real-time animation.
