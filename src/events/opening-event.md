We bring an exhibition of the work of the late great <span class="highlight">Ronald Searle</span> to our ADM gallery, which has been exclusively conceptualized and curated by ADM professors Kathrin Albers and Davide Benvenuti together with our gallery director Michelle Ho for the 2016 SAS conference.

With work on loan from the <a href="http://www.karikatur-museum.de/" target="_blank">Wilhelm Busch Museum</a> in Hannover and the <a href="http://www.iwm.org.uk/" target="_blank">Imperial War Museum</a> London, it will show a lot of fabulous pieces and illuminate Searleâ€™s time in Singapore.

Join us for the conference opening (catered reception).
