## Charles Lim: SEA STATE
<a href="http://ntu.ccasingapore.org/exhibitions/charles-lim-sea-state/" target="_blank">CCA Exhibition of Charles Lim: SEA STATE</a>

SEA STATE by artist Charles Lim, commissioned for the Singapore Pavilion for the 56th Venice Biennale and curated by Shabbir Hussain Mustafa, will be presented at the NTU CCA Singapore from 30 April to 10 July 2016. For over a decade, Lim’s ongoing project SEA STATE examines the biophysical, political and psychic contours of Singapore through the visible and invisible lenses of the sea.

SEA STATE is an in depth inquiry by an artist that scrutinises both man-made systems, opening new perspectives on our everyday surroundings, from unseen landscapes and disappearing islands to the imaginary boundaries of a future landmass.

To develop the Venice presentation, Lim was awarded a nine-month residency at the NTU CCA Singapore in 2014/2015. Lim’s engagement with Mustafa began when they initiated In Search of Raffles‘ Light (2012-) at the NUS Museum, a multimodal project that meditates upon Singapore’s vexed relationship with the sea.
