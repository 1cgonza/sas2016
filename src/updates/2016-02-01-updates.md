## Review process and notifications:
We were happily overwhelmed by the high number of submissions to the conference. The review process is coming a close by the first week of February. We will be able to send out acceptance letters
from Monday February 8.

## Conference registration:
We are currently working hard to have the conference registration up and running by the first week of March 2016.

This will include comprehensive information on accommodation offers and our planned special events and excursion(s).
