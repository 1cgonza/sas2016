We have scheduled a great new event that only came together in the last few days: A book signing session with famous animation artists <span class="highlight">Hans Bacher</span> and <span class="highlight">Ishu Patel</span> on Wednesday June 29 4-5 pm - right in front of the ADM auditorium.

They will be signing their books <span class="highlight">"Sketchbook-Composition Studies for Film"</span> and <span class="highlight">"Asian Lives: A Closer Look"</span> respectively. These are full of incredibly beautiful artwork-composition sketches by Hans Bacher and stunning photographs by Ishu Patel.

Their Singapore distributor APD will be there (and throughout the whole conference) and offer the books at a special conference price. A great opportunity to catch a signature (and perhaps a neat doodle?) from two of the most legendary animation artists ever.
