Dear ADM conference delegates,

We have an additional offer for you for Monday night **(June 27)**, complimentary transportation there and back from ADM will be provided - we will bring you to the place and back, but catering is self-paying this time around. This is hawker fare, but not on the extremely cheap side - but the location is fantastic.

As we need to plan the transportation capacities needed, please indicate your interest to the conference secretariat:

Spend an evening exploring Singapore's waterfront Gardens by the Bay set in the heart of the downtown city centre. The public botanic garden was awarded the **World Building of the Year 2012** at the World Architecture Festival, spanning a total of 101 hectares. Delegates can wind down in the evenings in its two conservatories or in the shade of 12 towering "Supertrees" which come to life with magical lights and music in the evenings. They can also stroll to the **Satay by the Bay** where they can enjoy local hawker culinary delights such as *satay*, *bak kut teh*, barbecued seafood, friend prawn noodles and *ice kachang* in a casual outdoor setting.
